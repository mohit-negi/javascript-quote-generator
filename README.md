- code: https://github.com/mohit-negi/javascript-quote-generator
- Live: https://mohit-negi.github.io/javascript-quote-generator/

Process: 
1. set different variables to seleect different elements
2. Add an array(more like structure(in c)) of Quotes containing various quotes and the author 
3. Add a Event listener to the button add a function to it
4. Function generates a random number depending upon the length of the array or structure containing quotes
  which then adds or edits the innertext and add quotes and their author to the div
